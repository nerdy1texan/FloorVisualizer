# floor-visualizer
Floor visualizer program that utilizes OpenCV to change the desired flooring texture using Python.

This project is currently still WIP (Work in progress). Even though there are certain bugs in the actual visualizer part (Some parts of images are classified as the "floor" part), the main functionality and visualizer works.
